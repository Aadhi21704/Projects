# Projects/RPS_Game

This is my take on the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
The modules "Random" and "Time" are used in this project.
Recently implemented a score counter for both player and the bot.

INSTRUCTIONS
* Rock breaks Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Ties/Draws don't count
* If both the player and the bot choose the same item, then it's a draw
* The game ends when the player or the bot gains 3 points
